<a name="carey-june2017"></a><h3>Judge Carey's ruling, June 2017</h3>

<p>In a blistering decision more than 100 pages long, Hampden County Superior Court Judge Richard Carey ruled that former state prosecutors Anne Kaczmarek and Kris Foster "deliberately withheld" exculpatory evidence — namely therapy worksheets showing Farak was using narcotics in the lab for far longer than had previously been ruled. Carey characterized their misconduct as a "fraud upon the court."</p>

<a name="caldwell"></a><h3>The Caldwell Report, April 2016</h3>

<p>After the <i>Cotto</i> ruling in April 2015, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office conducted an investigation into the scope of Sonja Farak's misconduct. During that investigation, the AGO immunized Farak to testify before grand jury. Four others testified before grand jury: James Hanchett, Sharon Salem, Rebecca Pontes, and Nancy Brooks. The report and grand jury transcripts are embedded below.</p> 
<p>This April 2016 report, signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas Caldwell, summarized findings that Farak began using methamphetamine taken from the Amherst lab's standards in late 2004 or early 2005, and that there were extensive periods during which she consumed meth each morning.</p>
<p>A footnote to the report (see p. 55, footnote 43) drew much ire from defense attorneys: "The AGO has provided the facts gleaned from its investigation without evaluation, without any determination about the credibility of any of the witnesses, and without the drawing of any conclusions."</p>
<p>(NOTE: This report was originally filed under impoundment. This impoundment order was vacated by Judge Carey in May 3, 2016 (see above, <i>Commonwealth vs. Erick Cotto and related others</i>, Memorandum of Decision and Order, May 3, 2016, p.22, 3. In the same order, Judge Carey lifted the impoundement order on grand jury minutes, see p.8-9).</p>

<a name="velis-merrigan"></a><h3>The Velis-Merrigan Report, March 2016</h3>
<p>In response to allegations by defense attorneys that two former state prosecutors — Anne Kaczmarek and Kris Foster — committed prosecutorial misconduct in handling the evidence seized from Farak's car, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office and the Northwestern District Attorney's Office deputized two retired judges to investigate. The judges, Peter Velis and Thomas Merrigan, partnered with two Massachusetts state troopers, Det. Capt. Paul L'Italien and Capt. James Coughlin, for their investigation.</p>

<p>The Velis-Merrigan report, submitted to Judge Carey in late March 2016, found "there is no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct by the Assistant Attorney Generals and MSP officers in matters related to the Farak case." In his June 2017 ruling following extensive evidentiary hearings, Judge Carey came to the exact opposite conclusion.</p> 

<p>Notably, although Velis and Merrigan characterized the troopers' investigation as "painstakingly thorough and detailed," Judge Carey ordered further investigation and evidentiary hearings. Defense attorneys successfully argued to Judge Carey that the troopers' "email audit" was not comprehensive as to internal AGO correspondence. Additionally, it seems their interview of Kaczmarek lasted approximately one hour, and there is no mention of any interview with Foster.</p>

<p>(NOTE: This report and attached exhibits were originally filed under non-dissemination and impoundment orders. These orders were vacated by Judge Carey in May 3, 2016 (see above, <i>Commonwealth vs. Erick Cotto and related others</i>, Memorandum of Decision and Order, May 3, 2016, p.22, 3.)</p>
