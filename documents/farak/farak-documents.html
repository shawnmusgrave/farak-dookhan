<h3>Judge Richard Carey's decision, June 2017</h3>

<p>In a blistering ruling more than 100 pages long, Hampden County Superior Court Judge Richard Carey ruled that former state prosecutors Anne Kaczmarek and Kris Foster committed "egregious misconduct" and "fraud upon the court."</p>

<h3>The "Caldwell Report", April 2016</h3>

<p>After the <i>Cotto</i> ruling in April 2015, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office conducted an investigation into the scope of Sonja Farak's misconduct. During that investigation, the AGO immunized Farak to testify before grand jury. Four others testified before grand jury: James Hanchett, Sharon Salem, Rebecca Pontes, and Nancy Brooks.</p> 
<p>This April 2016 report, signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas Caldwell, summarized findings that Farak began using methamphetamine taken from the Amherst lab's standards in late 2004 or early 2005, and that there were extensive periods during which she consumed meth each morning.</p>
<p>A footnote to the report (see p. 55, footnote 43) drew much ire from defense attorneys: "The AGO has provided the facts gleaned from its investigation without evaluation, without any determination about the credibility of any of the witnesses, and without the drawing of any conclusions."</p>
