<p>Since 2012, the Massachusetts criminal justice system has been dealing with fallout from two scandals at the state's forensic drug labs: <b>Annie Dookhan</b> (the Hinton lab in Jamaica Plain) and <b>Sonja Farak</b> (the Amherst lab).</p>

<p>Together, over the course of more than five years, these two scandals have resulted in the dismissal of roughly 30,000 convictions â€” the vast majority in two bulk dismissals in April and November 2017.</p>

<h2>Here you will find:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Timelines of both scandals</li>
    <li>Primary documents and court opinions</li>
    <li>Media coverage</li>
  </ul>

<p>This is very much a living project. If you spot missing information, documents, or context, please get in touch.</p>
