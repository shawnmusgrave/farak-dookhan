I've begun compiling archival audio from oral arguments before the Supreme Judicial Court for both the Hinton and Amherst scandals, starting with the most important cases. 

Today's case: *Bridgeman I*, in which the SJC declined to adopt the "global remedy" for Dookhan defendants. The court <a href="http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/471/471mass465.html" target="_blank">ruled</a>, however, that a Dookhan defendant who pleaded guilty and subsequently withdrew that plea could not be charged with a more serious offense or given a more severe sentence. This established what was subsequently called the Dookhan defendants' "exposure cap."

You can watch the January 2015 oral argument from *Bridgeman I* at Suffolk Law School's SJC video archive <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/sjc/pop.php?csnum=SJC_11764" target="_blank">here</a>, or download the audio <a href="https://github.com/shawnmusgrave/farak-dookhan/blob/master/documents/dookhan/court_cases/state/appellate/bridgeman-i/oral_arguments.zip" target="_blank">here (.zip)</a>.
