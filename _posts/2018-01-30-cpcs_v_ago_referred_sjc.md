title: "SJC to consider dismissing all Farak cases"

On Monday, Justice Frank Gaziano reported *CPCS v. AGO* to the full Supreme Judicial Court. 

See my coverage for the *Boston Globe* here, and more documents from the case [here](https://shawnmusgrave.github.io/farak-dookhan/documents/farak/farak-documents.html#cpcs-ago). 

Gaziano's order, embedded below, reports three questions to the SJC bench: 

1. Whether some or all of the defendants whose cases haven't yet been dismissed "are entitled to have their convictions vacated, and the drug charges against them dismissed with prejudice, given the undisputed misconduct of the assistant Attorneys General found by Judge Carey";

2. Whether the definition of "Farak defendants" is too narrow â€” that is, the definition "should be expanded to include all defendants who pleaded guilty to a drug charge, admitted to sufficient facts on a drug charge, or were found guilty of a drug charge, if the alleged drugs were tested at the Amherst Laboratory during Farak's employment there, regardless whether Farak was the analyst or signed the certificates in their cases." 

3. Whether the court should adopt "additional prophylactic measures to address future cases involving widespread prosecutorial misconduct."

The case will be scheduled for argument in May 2018.
