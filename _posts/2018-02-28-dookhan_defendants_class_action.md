In two lawsuits — one at the federal level and one to the top court in Massachusetts — Dookhan defendants whose charges were vacated are suing Massachusetts and top state officials, seeking the return of a range of fees and fines they paid in the course of their arrest, incarceration and probation. 

Both cases rely on *Nelson v. Colorado,* a Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/04/opinion-analysis-states-cant-keep-money-collect-pursuant-subsequently-overturned-convictions/" target="_blank">case</a> from April 2017 that held the state of Colorado was obliged to refund various fees to a woman exonerated of a felony. (As it happens, the *Nelson* decision came out on April 19, 2017, the same day the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court vacated more than 20,000 Dookhan-related convictions.)

See my coverage for the *Boston Globe* <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/23/dookhan-defendants-sue-for-return-probation-fees/AeG1WNKyOzDz5N95rd6gLN/story.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 

In the federal class action suit, filed on Friday, February 23, 2018, three plaintiffs seek return of fees, fines, and property, including: 

 - Court costs
 - Probation fees 
 - Mandatory assessments (such as drug testing and substance abuse counseling
 - Fines
 - Restitution
 - License-reinstatement fees
 - Forfeited property

 The plaintiffs also seek payment for "uncompensated labor," including "community service in lieu of required payments," according to the complaint embedded below. 

For the suit to proceed, the court must first decide whether to certify the class.

In a separate matter, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed to hear argument from a Dookhan defendant who paid more than $2,000 in fees after pleading guilty to drug possession charges. 

See coverage from the *Boston Herald* <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2018/02/drug_lab_scandal_sjc_to_decide_if_defendants_get_money_back" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Last year, a district court judge kicked the question of whether Jose Martinez should get back this money back to the Appeals Court. On Martinez's motion, the Supreme Judicial Court agreed on February 14, 2018 to hear the case. It has not yet been scheduled for argument, and briefs have not yet been filed to the SJC.
